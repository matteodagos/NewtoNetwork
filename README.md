The second function, "returnPersonLike," returns the username of a randomly selected user who has liked the post, or null if no users have liked the post. The functions use PostgreSQL queries to access database information.                                                   | script/getArrayPhotoLike.php              |
| backRegistration.php               | The code checks if the HTTP request type is "POST" and then connects to the database using pg_query_params(). It validates user's registration form information including email, username and password by checking if they match to the ones present in the database. If the entered email and username are not present in the database, the user's information is saved in the database, and the user is redirected to the login page. If the process fails, the user will be prompted for the next step. | script/backRegistration.php               |
| backAddFriend.php                  | This PHP code snippet is checking if the HTTP request method is GET and if there is an active session. It includes a database connection and performs several queries to determine if specific friend requests or friendships already exist before inserting a new friend request into the database. If any of the checks fail, it redirects back to the addFriend page with an appropriate error message. If all checks pass, it redirects to the index page.                                             | script/backAddFriend.php                  |
| leaveLike.php                      | This PHP code snippet inserts a'like' record into a database when a user clicks a'like' button on a post. A notification is also created for the user who owns the post to inform them that someone has liked the post. The code responds with the number of likes on the post, minus one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | script/leaveLike.php                      |
| backLogin.php                      | This PHP code snippet creates a login function. If the server request method is not POST, it redirects to the login page. It also checks if the username exists in a database, and if the password matches the hashed password in the user's account. Once the credentials are verified, a session is started, and the user is logged in.                                                                                                                                                                  | script/backLogin.php                      |
| discardRequest.php                 | The code snippet checks if the HTTP method used is GET, allows session handling or initiation, connects to a SQL database, and executes a SELECT and INSERT statement respectively. The SELECT statement deletes a friend request while the INSERT statement creates a notification to be sent to the sender of the friend request indicating that it was declined. Finally, the SQL connection is closed.                                                                                                 | script/discardRequest.php                 |
| removeLike.php                     | The code checks if the request method is GET and starts a session if one is not active. It then deletes a like record matching the user_id and post_id passed as GET parameters and calculates the number of likes left on that post. The remaining likes are then echoed as output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | script/removeLike.php                     |
| showComments.php                   | The provided code snippet selects and fetches comments from a specific post in a database and constructs HTML code for each comment, making use of the included "convertTimeFromTimestampToTime.php" function to display the comment date and time. The constructed HTML code is appended to a variable named "send" and then printed to output.                                                                                                                                                           | script/showComments.php                   |
| clearNotifications.php             | This PHP code snippet checks if the request method is GET and redirects to the index page if it's not. It then starts a PHP session and includes a connection to a PostgreSQL database. The code proceeds to execute a query that deletes all notifications associated the user currently in session.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | script/clearNotifications.php             |
| setGlobalVariables.php             | This code snippet uses PHP and PostgreSQL to query a user's information from a database based on their session's username, then assigns the found values to variables. It also redirects to a homepage if session data is not defined, or assigns default "guest" information if the session data is not in the database.                                                                                                                                                                                  | script/setGlobalVariables.php             |
| backPost.php                       | This code snippet is a PHP script that creates a new post by inserting the user's input into a database table. The script first verifies that the HTTP request method is POST and starts a PHP session. The user's input is then inserted into the'posts' table along with an encode version of an uploaded photo. Finally, notifications are sent to the user's friends for this post and the user is redirected back to the homepage.                                                                    | script/backPost.php                       |
| printLikePhotos.php                | The code snippet retrieves the likes associated with a given post by querying a PostgreSQL database, selects three users randomly and renders their profile photo using "printPhoto.php". Ultimately, the script displays the thumbnails of the profile pictures of the three users who liked the post.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | script/printLikePhotos.php                |
